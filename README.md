# Team-9-Final-Project

# Next Wave Collection

This project was an Arizona State University class project for CPI 310. The goal of this project was to build a fully functional website of our own creation using Javascript and Node.JS as the basis for the backend of the webiste. Our website is a site used to help you discover and manage all aspects of indie media, rangining anywhere from books, movies, games, and music.
